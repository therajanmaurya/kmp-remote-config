# Asserts every cmp-* module ships complete, non-dangling docs.
#
# The failures this catches, all of which actually happened in this repo:
#   D1  a module with no README.md at all — 13 of 27 were missing one, invisible because nothing
#       ever looked. A module copied from cmp-library inherits the template's docs and it is easy
#       to ship without ever writing your own.
#   D2  docs that do not point at TARGET_MATRIX.md, the single source of truth for which KMP
#       targets a module must ship. Without the pointer the next author guesses the matrix.
#   D3  a relative link to a file that does not exist. These are written by hand, they rot when a
#       module is renamed or split (cmp-observe -> cmp-observe-firebase), and a dead link in a
#       README is invisible until a reader clicks it.
#
# Relative links climbing three or more levels (`../../../…`) are SKIPPED: DEVELOPMENT.md links its
# GOAL.md in the framework superproject, which is not part of this repository, so such a target can
# never resolve from a repo checkout and is not a defect in the doc. Everything that stays inside the
# repo is checked.
#
# NOT checked: prose accuracy. A README can still name an API that does not exist — that is a
# review concern, not a mechanical one. (It happened here: four invented symbol names, caught by
# grepping each claim against the source. Worth doing by hand when you write one.)
#
# bash 3.2 compatible (macOS runners): no mapfile, no associative arrays, no ${ARR[@]} under set -u.
