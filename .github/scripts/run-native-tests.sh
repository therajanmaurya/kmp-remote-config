# Run a Kotlin/Native test task across the cmp-* LIBRARY modules, skipping the sample apps.
#
# WHY THE SAMPLES ARE EXCLUDED
# `./gradlew iosSimulatorArm64Test` from the root runs that task in EVERY project declaring the
# target, including the `samples/*/composeApp` Compose apps. Measured on run 34639024914:
# 770 of 1662 graphed tasks (46%) were `:samples:*`, each app dragging its own SwiftPM synthetic-
# package resolution (fetchSyntheticImportProjectPackages, dumpXcodebuildArgsIphonesimulator,
# linkDebugTestIosSimulatorArm64) through the slow Firebase path. The iOS job hit its 45-minute
# timeout mid-link on the LAST sample and was cancelled — the library tests had already run; the
# remainder of the budget went to samples.
#
# What that bought: five `ComposeAppCommonTest.example` cases, every one the `assertEquals(3, 1 + 2)`
# boilerplate the KMP wizard emits. Not one line of library behaviour.
#
# This workflow exists to execute `commonTest` on native targets, where an assertion can be wrong
# while passing on JVM/JS (the 3.5.23 Apple incident). That is a claim about the cmp-* modules.
# Whether the samples still COMPILE and LINK for iOS is real coverage, but it belongs to
# compile-all-targets, which runs them on every push (15m54s, green).
#
# Verified with `--dry-run` on iosSimulatorArm64Test: 1662 -> 876 graphed tasks, samples 770 -> 11
# (those 11 being a SKIPPED lock-file metadata task), and all 22 `:cmp-*:iosSimulatorArm64Test`
# tasks byte-identical to the unpruned graph — no library test is lost.
#
# WHY EACH SAMPLE IS TARGET-CHECKED FIRST
# `-x` on a task path that does not exist is a hard configuration failure ("Cannot locate excluded
# tasks that match ..."), not a no-op. The samples declare ONLY iosArm64 + iosSimulatorArm64, so
# blanket exclusion would break the watchOS, Linux and Windows jobs — measured: 0 sample tasks in
# the linuxX64Test and mingwX64Test graphs. A sample is therefore excluded only when its own build
# file declares the target this task belongs to; otherwise the invocation is left untouched, which
# is exactly today's (correct) behaviour for those jobs.
#
# This script invokes Gradle itself rather than emitting flags for the caller to interpolate:
# `./gradlew $(emit-flags)` depends on word-splitting the substitution, which produced ONE argument
# on a shell whose IFS lacks a space, and Gradle then failed with "Empty segments" on a task path
# containing the entire flag list. An array passed directly cannot misbehave that way.
